Current Status:
Base game mechanics finished. The current base code can be implemented in an infinite amount of ways to create many different levels with ease.

Goals:
- Incorporate blocks that cause you to die if you land on the (moderate)
- Incorporate a finish line so the level actually ends and goes to the next one (moderate)
- Add sounds (easy)
- Add enemy sprites (hard)
